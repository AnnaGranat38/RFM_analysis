--1. Подготовка базовых метрик RFM
--рассчитываем ключевые метрики для каждого клиента:
-- Recency — сколько дней прошло с последней покупки;
-- Frequency — количество покупок;
--Monetary — общая сумма трат.

COUNT(*) AS frequency,
SUM(summ) AS monetary
FROM bonuscheques
WHERE card LIKE '2000%' 
GROUP BY card
ORDER BY Frequency desc, Monetary desc, recency;

--Основные показатели

WHERE card LIKE '2000%'
AND card NOT IN ('2000200189985', '2000200170860', '2000200196556');

-- Шаг 2. Анализ распределения с помощью PERCENTILE
--**Задача:** понять, где находятся «естественные» границы между сегментами, не прибегая к субъективным оценкам.
